# S Wing Control
Control your LightShark LS-Wing with chataigne (OSC implementation)
Select Mode 5 (pressing SEL-5 button) at startup of your LS-Wing to use the OSC/UDP-Mode

The LS-Wing is a multitask hardware controller. It has 6 rows of 10 buttons and 10 faders, all of them configurable twice on two pages.
Initially it controls the LightShark LS-1 and LS-Core (Modes 1 to 3); but it can also be configured as a pure MIDI-controller (Mode4) or OSC/UDP controller (Mode5)

You can connect to its Web-Server via the default addresses lswing.local or 2.0.0.11 or by a freely configurable (static) IP address to integrate into your network
The default OSC Ports are
Incoming: 8000 and Outgoing: 9000 (but can be changed if necessary!)

the LS-Wing can also be controlled by DMX-Remote and the LS-Wing integrate two Nodes (ArtNet or ACN versus DMX).
All these features make the LS-Wing quite unique and versatile.
