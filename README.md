# S Wing Control
Control the LightShark LS-Wing with Chataigne by OSC

Select Mode-5 (pressing SEL-5 button) at startup of your LS-Wing to use the OSC/UDP-Mode
and "OSC Remote Control" must be set to "ON" in the "Wing Settings" !

The LS-Wing is a multitask controller. It has 6 rows of 10 buttons and 10 faders, all of them configurable on two pages.

Initially it controls the LightShark LS-1 and LS-Core (Mode-1 to 3); but it can also be configured as a pure MIDI-controller (Mode-4) or OSC/UDP controller (Mode-5)

You can connect to its Web-Server via the default addresses lswing.local or 2.0.0.11 or by a freely configurable (static) IP address to integrate it into your network

The default OSC Ports are :
Incoming: 8000 and Outgoing: 9000 (but can be changed if necessary!)

The LS-Wing can also be controlled by DMX-Remote and the LS-Wing integrate two Nodes (ArtNet or ACN versus DMX).

All these features make the LS-Wing quite unique and versatile.
